# Approach for "Add Expense" feature

# 1. Create a form in the UI with fields for the expense name, amount, and date.
#    - Use controlled components to handle form state in React.

# 2. When the form is submitted, prevent the default form submission behavior.
#    - This can be done in the form's onSubmit event handler.

# 3. In the form's onSubmit event handler, create a new expense object with the form data.
#    - The expense object should have properties for the name, amount, and date.

# 4. Add the new expense object to the application's state.
#    - If you're using the Context API for state management, this could involve dispatching an action to the context.

# 5. Clear the form fields after the new expense is added.
#    - This can be done by setting the form state back to its initial state.

# 6. Optionally, display a confirmation message to the user after the new expense is added.
